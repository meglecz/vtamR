## Installation

**Option 1**: Install from the latest tarball (recommended).
Installing from the tarball includes the **vignettes**, which demonstrate a complete analysis workflow.

```{r install_tarball, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/meglecz/vtamR/releases/download/v0.2.0-test1/vtamR_0.2.0.tar.gz")
```

After installation, you can access the vignettes with:

```{r browseVignettes, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("vtamR")
```

**Option 2**: Install from the GitHub repository (vignettes not included).
You can also install `vtamR` directly from GitHub. 
However, vignettes will not be included in this case due to how GitHub installations work.

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("meglecz/vtamR@develop")
```

You can still view the HTML versions of the vignettes online:

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(vtamR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
